/*The ReboundScout program is a Java application that was designed to keep track
 * of statistics related to the First Robotics competition of 2011-2012. The 
 * program does this by giving the user an interface in which they can easily 
 * increment various stat counters and adjust other values. The application then
 * uses the collected data and displays it in an organized and sortable table 
 * for the userï¿½s convenience. While the software has many functions, a brief 
 * outline of important features of the application would include:
 *	- An interface to accurately record the stats
 *	- Writing recorded stats to a file
 *      - Open those files organizing the data into a table
 *      - Manipulating the data through addition, deletion, and sorting.
 *      - Displaying a detailed description of each robot with its stats and 
 *          specs.
